** About
An attempt to create a new JavaScript editing mode for Emacs.

** Installation
Probably shouldn't not do that now...

The lexer is the only functional component at the moment.

** Goals   
Create a simple syntax parser to allow more complex highlighting and
indentation of code while editing JavaScript in Emacs buffers.

** Reasoning
Shear madness.

After getting frustrated during an attempt to modify the indentation
functionality of ~js.el~, I concluded a simple syntax parser would
provide a more complete understanding of the code for editing
purposes. Plus I needed something to do in my spare time.

** Working
Most functions of the lexer are complete and are tested. I have been
performing informal tests of the lexer with [[http://underscorejs.org/][Underscore.js]] and it seems
to be tokenizing everything correctly.

Soon work on the parser will begin. I am currently studying the
JavaScript mode of [[https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/mode/javascript/javascript.js][CodeMirror]]. The intent of its parser is the
exact same as my own, provide syntax highlighting and indentation.
