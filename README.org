** About
This project is an attempt to create a new JavaScript editing mode for
Emacs.

Jove includes a striped down port of the [[https://github.com/ternjs/acorn][Acorn]] parser in order to
provide complex highlighting and indentation functionality.

** Installation
Probably shouldn't not do that quite yet... getting close though!

** Reasoning
Shear madness.

After getting frustrated in an attempt to modify the indentation code
of ~js.el~, I concluded a /*simple*/ (ha, ha, ha...)  syntax parser
would provide a more complete understanding of the code for editing
purposes. Plus I needed something to do in my spare time.

** Working
The functions of the lexer are complete and tested. The parser
functions are mostly complete and untested. I have been performing
informal tests of the parser with [[http://underscorejs.org/][Underscore]] and [[http://jquery.com][JQuery]], it seems to
be parsing everything correctly.
