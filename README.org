** About
This project is an attempt to create a new JavaScript editing mode for
Emacs.

Jove includes a striped down port of the [[https://github.com/ternjs/acorn][Acorn]] parser in order to
provide complex highlighting and indentation functionality.

*** Inspiration
- [[https://github.com/marijnh/parse-js][parse-js]] written in Common Lisp by Marijn Haverbeke

** Installation
Probably shouldn't not do that quite yet... though getting close!

** Reasoning
Shear madness.

After getting frustrated during an attempt to modify the indentation
functionality of ~js.el~, I concluded a /simple*/ syntax parser would
provide a more complete understanding of the code for editing
purposes. Plus I needed something to do in my spare time.

** Working
Most functions of the lexer are complete and are tested. I have been
performing informal tests of the lexer with [[http://underscorejs.org/][Underscore.js]] and it seems
to be tokenizing everything correctly.

Work on the parser has begun. The expression parsing functions are
written, though I have not started on the tests yet.
