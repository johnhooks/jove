** About
This project is an attempt to create a new JavaScript editing mode for Emacs. 

Jove includes a striped down port of the [[https://github.com/ternjs/acorn][Acorn]] parser in order to provide
complex highlighting and indentation functionality.

*** Inspiration
- [[https://github.com/marijnh/parse-js][parse-js]] written in Common Lisp by Marijn Haverbeke
- [[https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/mode/javascript/javascript.js][CodeMirror]]
- [[https://github.com/ternjs/acorn][Acorn]]
- [[https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2][UglifyJS]]

** Installation
Probably shouldn't not do that now...

The lexer is the only functional component at the moment.

** Goals
1. Provide proper indentation of
   - arrow functions (in the works)
   - conditional expressions (in the works)
2. Provide proper highlighting of
   - template strings
   - regular expressions
3. Provide functionality for JSX (a ways off)

** Reasoning
Shear madness.

After getting frustrated during an attempt to modify the indentation
functionality of ~js.el~, I concluded a simple syntax parser would
provide a more complete understanding of the code for editing
purposes. Plus I needed something to do in my spare time.

** Working
Most functions of the lexer are complete and are tested. I have been
performing informal tests of the lexer with [[http://underscorejs.org/][Underscore.js]] and it seems
to be tokenizing everything correctly.

Soon work on the parser will begin. I am currently studying the
JavaScript mode of [[https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/mode/javascript/javascript.js][CodeMirror]]. The intent of its parser is the
exact same as my own, provide syntax highlighting and indentation.
